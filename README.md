# RataStructure

RataStructure is a Python library providing a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms, designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use. Inspired by educational and practical needs, RataStructure aims to help students, developers, and researchers by offering ready-to-use components and clear documentation.

> **Note:**  
> The current implementation is primarily **functional programming**. There are plans to migrate the library to an **object-oriented (class-based) structure** in the future to further improve usability and maintainability.

## Features

- Classic and advanced data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, etc.)
- A variety of algorithms (sorting, searching, graph algorithms, etc.)
- Functional programming style for now; class-based API will be introduced in the future
- Pythonic interfaces (**type hints will be available soon**)
- Well-documented code and auto-generated API docs
- Designed for learning, teaching, and real-world use
- Easy installation from PyPI (**coming soon**)

## Origin and Inspiration

- **Unit tests** and the **API design** are based on the [Data Structures and Algorithms course at Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/), aiming to provide a familiar interface for students and educators.

## Installation

RataStructure will soon be available on PyPI.  
Stay tuned for the release!

```bash
pip install ratastructure
```

## Usage

Usage examples will be available in the documentation and future releases.
